# Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio of data science projects I completed.  Some of the projects I've worked on came from the [University of Wisconsin  -- Master of Science Data Science](https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/) program.


## University of Wisconsin -- Data Science Projects
### Predict Diamond Price And Loan Classification With Optimization For Machine Learning
This completed project is the second of two class projects required for DS 775 - Prescriptive Analytics. It uses Python to apply hyperparameter optimization to both regression and classification problems for machine learning.

### Find Maximum Airfare By Combining Predictive And Prescriptive Analytics
This completed project is first of two class projects required for DS 775 - Prescriptive Analytics. It uses Python to compute linear regression models and extract coefficients from linear regression models to build constraint expressions for a linear program.

### Predicting Infant Birth Weight With Machine Learning Models
This completed project is required for DS 740 - Data Mining & Machine Learning. It uses R machine learning analysis to determine risk factors associated with low infant birth weights.

### Performing OLAP with SSAS and MDX	
This completed project is a result of a progression of previous assignments required for DS 715 - Data Warehousing. It uses linear program in to find maximum airline fares.
