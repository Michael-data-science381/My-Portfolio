# Data Science Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio of data science projects I completed.  Some of the projects I've worked on came from the [University of Wisconsin  -- Master of Science Data Science](https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/) program.


## University of Wisconsin -- Data Science Projects
### AWS Cloud Computing with Apache Zeppelin in Big Data   
This completed project is required for DS 730 - Big Data: High Performance Computing.  It uses Apache Spark (Scala) to determine factors involving detection of lung cancer.
- Constructed a classification model pipeline by specifying input and output columns
- Supervised learning with splitting data into train and test models
- Fitted a random forest classification model for predicting lung cancer
- Established lung cancer predictions from trained models 

### High Performance Computing with Hive in Big Data    
- Used Hive language to retrieve data storage files from a large cluster of machines
- Created tables for a project and apply schema to retrieved data
- Partitioned data by splicing data from tables into files to increase query performance
- Identified rows in the data that satisfy a criterion to speed up querying time

   
### Diamond Price and Loan Classification Optimization for Machine Learning
This is the second of two class projects required for DS 775 - Prescriptive Analytics. It uses Python to apply hyperparameter optimization to both regression and classification problems for machine learning.
- Tuned hyperparameters with Python for both regression and classification predictive models 
- Fitted a random forest regression model for predicting diamond prices
- Fitted a XGboost classification model for predicting bank loan defaults
- Conducted a grid search to acquire a model score with cross validation
- Applied Bayesian Optimization method to deliver maximum objective function
   
### Maximum Airfare Pricing by Combining Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics
This project is the first of two class projects required for DS 775 - Prescriptive Analytics. It uses Python to compute linear regression models and extract coefficients from linear regression models to build constraint expressions for a linear program.
- Combined Linear Regression and Linear Programming for maximizing airline ticket fares
- Computed linear regression and multiple linear regression models with Python
- Extracted model coefficients to build objectives and constraint expressions for a linear program
- Conducted sensitivity analysis by changing resource constraints in a linear program

### Predicting Infant Birth Weight with Machine Learning Models
This completed project is required for DS 740 - Data Mining & Machine Learning. It uses R machine learning analysis to determine risk factors associated with low infant birth weights.
- Used R and R Studio identify appropriate methods for analyzing data 
- Developed computer programs to clean data and impute missing values
- Applied statistical analysis to assess machine learning model for predicting infant birth weight
- Conducted Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regression to assess all models
- Applied supervised learning methods with double cross validations to select best model

### Performing OLAP with SSAS and MDX	
This completed project is a required for DS 715 - Data Warehousing. It demonstrates the use of SSAS interactive features and MDX queries to perform OLAP operations from a make believe entrepreneurial company database.
- Used Microsoft SQL Server to populate database tables with sampled data
- Performed SQL queries that involve various forms of ‘GROUP BY’ and ‘HAVING’ clause
- Demonstrated the use of SQL to perform OLAP operations
- Executed interactive OLAP with MDX query language to retrieve multidimensional data in SSAS
